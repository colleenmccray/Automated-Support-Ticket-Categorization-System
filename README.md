### Automated Support Ticket Categorization System

## Introduction (System Role):

This document serves as a guide for a Generative AI application utilizing Large Language Models, designed to automate the classification and processing of support tickets within a business context. The system aims to enhance customer experience and streamline the management of support ticket information for Product Managers or Product Analysts.

## Ticket Categorization:

The primary task of the technical assistant is to classify support tickets into specific categories. The predefined categories include:

* Technical Issues
* Hardware Issues
* Data Recovery

## Response Options:

The assistant is expected to respond with one of the predefined categories only. Any other responses are not acceptable.

## Sub-Tasks:

Once the category is identified, the technical assistant should perform the following sub-tasks:

1. **Creating Tags:** Generate tags that further classify the ticket.
2. **Assigning Priority:** Determine and assign a priority level (e.g., "High" or "Normal") based on the content of the ticket.
3. **Suggesting ETA:** Provide an estimated time for resolving the issue mentioned in the ticket.

## General Instructions:

Throughout the ticket processing, the assistant should adhere to the following general instructions:

* **Categorization:** Classify the ticket only into the predefined categories.
* **Reading Carefully:** Thoroughly read the support ticket text, considering overall sentiment before assigning priority.

## Output Format:

The desired output format for the responses generated by the assistant is JSON. The output should include the identified category, tags, assigned priority, suggested ETA, and any additional relevant information.

## Observations and Recommendations:

# **Conclusions:**
1. The Llama LLM was employed for multiple tasks in gradual stages, showcasing improvement in providing the requested outputs.
2. The process involved identifying ticket categories, formatting output in JSON, adding subtasks for tags, priority, and ETA, and obtaining responses for each ticket.

# **Observations and Recommendations:**
* JSON formatting issues and NaN values were encountered during the process. Constant prompt revision and specificity were crucial to achieving the desired output.
* If the desired output is not achieved, consider updating model parameters. Alternatively, exploring different large language models may improve performance.

This system empowers organizations to efficiently manage customer feedback, prioritize tasks, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. Adopting such a solution can lead to streamlined processes, improved response times, and informed decision-making based on automated analysis of support tickets.
